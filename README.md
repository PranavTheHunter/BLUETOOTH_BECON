Here’s the step-by-step process for setting up your Bluetooth Beacon app with the instructions you’ve provided:

### Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

1. **Install Node.js (if not installed)**
   - Download and install **Node.js v22** from the official website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. **Create the Expo App**
   - Open your command prompt or terminal and run:
     ```bash
     npx create-expo-app
     ```
   - This will prompt you to enter an app name. Enter:
     ```bash
     bluetoothBeacon
     ```

   - It will create a folder named `bluetoothBeacon`.

3. **Navigate to the App Folder**
   - After the app is created, navigate into the folder by running:
     ```bash
     cd bluetoothBeacon
     ```

4. **Delete the Existing App Folder**
   - Delete the contents of the `bluetoothBeacon` folder (this includes the default template files) and replace it with your own app folder contents. You can simply copy the files and paste them into the `bluetoothBeacon` folder.

5. **Replace `package.json` File**
   - Replace the existing `package.json` file with the one you have provided. You can copy the content from your provided `package.json` and replace the default one.

6. **Install Dependencies**
   - In the command prompt (still inside the `bluetoothBeacon` folder), run:
     ```bash
     npx expo install
     ```
   - This will install the required dependencies for the app.

7. **Start the App**
   - Once all dependencies are installed, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will start the Expo development server and provide you with a QR code.

8. **Run the App**
   - Open the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device (you can download it from the app store if not installed already).
   - Scan the QR code shown in your terminal using the Expo Go app to preview the app on your mobile device.

Your Bluetooth Beacon app should now be up and running on your device! Let me know if you need any further assistance with this process.
